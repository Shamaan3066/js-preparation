<!-- 
    Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener
    is usesd to manage all similar events for multiple child elements by leveraging
    event bubbling. Event delegation leverages(to use something to maximum advantage)
    event bubbling to handle events more efficiently by attaching a single event listener
    to a common ancestor element rather than individual child element.

    Event Bubbling: When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers on the target element
    and then bubbles up to its parent elements, eventually reaching the root of the document.

    Event Targeting: Within the event handler, we can use the 'event.target' property to
    identify the actual element that triggered the event.
